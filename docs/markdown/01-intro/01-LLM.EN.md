Notes:
- The audience already knows chat interactions
- Natural transition to agents
- Ask the fundamental question

# Reminder: What is an LLM?

**Large Language Model** = Large language model

<br/>

```text
Input (Prompt)          LLM          Output (Completion)
     "Hello" ────────> [🤖] ────────> "Hello! How..."
```

- Trained on billions of texts
- Predicts the most likely next token
- Understands context and generates coherent text

Notes:
- Reminder of basics to start well
- LLM is stateless by default
- Generation is probabilistic

| Answer questions | Execute actions |
| Generate text | Access your data |
| Explain concepts | Remember between sessions |
| Translate, summarize | Use external tools |

### 💡 Agents fill these gaps

Notes:
- Identify common frustrations
- Lay the foundation for agent value
- Prepare the definition of an agent
