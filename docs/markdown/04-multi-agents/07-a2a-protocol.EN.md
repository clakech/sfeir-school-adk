<br>

### Characteristics:
- 📨 **JSON**-based message format
- 🔌 **Transport-agnostic** (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.)
- 🌐 **Standardization** of inter-agent communication
- 🤝 **Interoperability** between different frameworks

<br>

HTTP for web pages, **A2A for AI agents**

# Why is A2A Important?

## Advantages of Standardized Protocol

<br>

### ✅ **Interoperability**
Different agent frameworks can communicate

### 📏 **Standardization**
Common language for agent interactions

### 🏪 **Ecosystem**
Marketplace of specialized agents possible

### 🔄 **Flexibility**
Mix agents from different providers

## Use Cases:
- Enterprise systems with agents from multiple vendors
- Marketplaces and agent ecosystems

Notes:
A2A prepares the future where agents become interoperable like microservices
